There are 3 types of require
    1. require('fs'); - part of the node infrastructure
    2. require('./utils'); - importing our own creation
    3. require('validator') - after init and downloading it


Importing an NPM module app:
    Firstly init npm in the root app folder (this creates the json)
    Find a package to use on the NPM site
    install the package in the root directory
    If the node-modules folder is deleted, 'node install' reads the json files and recreates them


Setting an NPM module as Global
    Installing a global module means it can be used from the command line
    It doesnt need to be imported into a specific project henc the json files are not updated
    sudo npm install nodemon@1.18.5 -g
    nodemon - (For example) Runs automatically each time a page is saved. 


Inputs in the form of Args can be entered from the console
    Using nodes "Process" we can use all the command line argumets passed into our app
    console.log("Process.arg0 : " + process.argv[0]); - File Details
    console.log("Process.arg0 : " + process.argv[1]); - File Details
    console.log("Process.arg0 : " + process.argv[2]); - User Input


The NPM module yargs can be imported and is a better form of user Input
    const yargs1 = require('yargs').argv;
    yargs1.title
    --title='This is the tile of my app

yargs can be used with .command which can be linked to a function depending on the input
        yargs.command({
            command : "read",
            describe : "Output the list to be read",
            handler : function(){
                console.log("Displaying the list")
            }
        }).parse();
